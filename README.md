## üåç About Me
"In an era where accelerated AI demands more than mere advantage, adaptability is the foundation of innovation."

I have always been drawn to complex systems‚Äîwhether in intelligence, biology, or artificial cognition. My journey began in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, where I explored how intelligence emerges, adapts, and learns. When the pandemic disrupted my academic path, I pivoted‚Äîimmersing myself in bioinformatics and environmental data analysis to understand how AI-driven insights could revolutionize scientific research.

Then, AI transformed everything.

I realized that intelligence, whether human, biological, or artificial, follows core principles of adaptation and optimization. My focus shifted to machine learning, multi-agent AI, and scalable automation, applying AI not just to solve problems but to amplify discovery.

I engineer AI systems that push boundaries, accelerate research, and augment human expertise. With a background spanning cognitive science, bioinformatics, and AI engineering, I specialize in:

- Multi-Agent AI and LLM Optimization ‚Äì Building intelligent agent systems that enhance AI-driven automation and problem-solving.
- AI for Science ‚Äì Developing AI-powered research tools for bioinformatics, genomics, and cognitive AI modeling.
- Scalable AI and Systems Programming ‚Äì Combining Python, C++, and Go to create AI architectures that are fast, efficient, and built for real-world applications.

AI is redefining how science is conducted‚Äîfrom genomics to cognitive modeling to environmental intelligence. My mission is to build AI that enhances discovery, scales problem-solving, and transforms data into meaningful insights.
