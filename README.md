## 🌍 About Me
"In an era where accelerated AI demands more than mere advantage, adaptability is the foundation of innovation."

I have always been drawn to complex systems—whether in intelligence, biology, or artificial cognition. My journey began in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, where I explored how intelligence emerges, adapts, and learns. When the pandemic disrupted my academic path, I pivoted—immersing myself in bioinformatics and environmental data analysis to understand how AI-driven insights could revolutionize scientific research.

Then, AI transformed everything.

I realized that intelligence, whether human, biological, or artificial, follows core principles of adaptation and optimization. My focus shifted to machine learning, multi-agent AI, and scalable automation, applying AI not just to solve problems but to amplify discovery.

AI is reshaping science—from genomics to cognitive modeling to environmental intelligence—but many AI models fail to integrate domain-specific knowledge effectively. That’s where I come in. My mission is to bridge the gap between AI and domain expertise, ensuring that machine learning systems are not just powerful, but meaningful in real-world applications.
