## 🌍 Sobre Mim

Sou um jovem profissional, apaixonado por projetar e implementar sistemas de IA fullstack inspirados por meu background interdisciplinar único: Biologia, Psicologia, Filosofia, Ciência da Computação e Arquitetura e Engenharia de IA/ML.

Isso não é apenas um trabalho ou carreira para mim; é a aplicação prática de uma obsessão vitalícia pela natureza da própria inteligência e anos de estudos acadêmicos formais.

Meu ideal de longo prazo é utilizar meu background acadêmico para conectar Biologia e IA na resolução de problemas biológicos/biomédicos do mundo real.

🛠️ **Expertise Técnica**

* **Arquitetura de Sistemas IA & MLOps:** Projeto sistemas escaláveis, robustos e inteligentes desde o conceito até a implementação.

* **Full-Stack & Edge AI:** Sou proficiente em toda a stack tecnológica. Isso inclui desenvolvimento backend (**Python, C++, FastAPI**), infraestrutura em nuvem (**AWS**), bancos de dados complexos (**PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB**), e frameworks ML principais (**PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn**), estendendo-se até desenvolvimento de hardware e **IoT** com dispositivos como o **ESP32**.

* **IA Agêntica & LLMs:** Minha especialização está na fronteira da IA. Desenvolvo "forças de trabalho inteligentes" e tenho experiência prática profunda em pós-treinamento de Large Language Models usando técnicas avançadas como **SFT e RLHF**.

🏆 **Impacto Comprovado & Pesquisa**

* **Liderança & Projetos Premiados:** Prospero na colaboração e servi como Líder de Projeto na comunidade internacional SuperDataScience. Também fui o arquiteto e engenheiro solo do **projeto vencedor do Global Solution Challenge 2025 da FIAP**.

* **Pesquisa & Aplicação Interdisciplinar:** Meu trabalho técnico é informado por um background de pesquisa profundo, desde uma tese sobre ciência cognitiva fundamental na GSU até pesquisa aplicada em **Bio-IA** sobre anti-envelhecimento epigenético. Essa paixão por aplicar IA a desafios científicos continua com meu papel atual como **Estagiário de P&D na Embrapa**, focando em dados & genômica animal.

Estou sempre aberto a me conectar com colegas construtores, pesquisadores e líderes para discutir o futuro dos sistemas inteligentes.
