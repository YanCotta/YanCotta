## 🌍 About Me


I've been creating Intelligent Systems by uniting Biological Science, Cognitive Science, and Computer Science into FullStack AI Systems. 

I'm a junior, passionate about designing and deploying AI systems that are inspired by my unique interdiciplinary background: Biology, Psychology, Philosophy of Mind, and AI/ML Architecture and Engineering. 

This is not just a job or a career for me; it is the practical application of a lifelong obsession into the nature of intelligent itself, and years of formal academic studies.

My long-term ideal is to utilize my academic background to bridge Biology and AI into solving real-world biological/biomedical problems. My mission now is to begin orchestrating intelligent workforces and driving innovation in companies and institutions, with likeminded individuals. 

I am driven to architect and govern these powerful new systems responsibly and am looking for a team that shares this vision.
