## 🌍 Sobre Mim

Sou um jovem profissional, apaixonado por projetar e implementar sistemas de IA fullstack inspirados por meu background interdisciplinar único: Biologia, Psicologia, Filosofia, Ciência da Computação e Arquitetura e Engenharia de IA/ML.

Isso não é apenas um trabalho ou carreira para mim; é a aplicação prática de uma obsessão vitalícia pela natureza da própria inteligência e anos de estudos acadêmicos formais.

Meu ideal de longo prazo é utilizar meu background acadêmico para conectar Biologia e IA na resolução de problemas biológicos/biomédicos do mundo real.

🛠️ **Expertise Técnica**

* **Arquitetura de Sistemas IA & MLOps:** Projeto sistemas escaláveis, robustos e inteligentes desde o conceito até a implementação. Minha expertise cobre todo o **ciclo de vida ML end-to-end**, desde data science e engenharia de features até **MLOps e LLMOps** de nível produção para garantir que os modelos entreguem valor no mundo real.

* **Full-Stack & Edge AI:** Sou proficiente em toda a stack tecnológica. Isso inclui desenvolvimento backend (**Python, C++, FastAPI**), infraestrutura em nuvem (**AWS**), bancos de dados complexos (**PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB**), e frameworks ML principais (**PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn**), estendendo-se até desenvolvimento de hardware e **IoT** com dispositivos como o **ESP32**.

* **IA Agêntica & LLMs:** Minha especialização está na fronteira da IA. Desenvolvo "forças de trabalho inteligentes" e tenho experiência prática profunda em pós-treinamento de Large Language Models usando técnicas avançadas como **SFT e RLHF**.

🏆 **Impacto Comprovado & Pesquisa**

* **Liderança & Projetos Premiados:** Prospero na colaboração e servi como Líder de Projeto na comunidade internacional SuperDataScience. Também fui o arquiteto e engenheiro solo do **projeto vencedor do Global Solution Challenge 2025 da FIAP**.

* **Pesquisa & Aplicação Interdisciplinar:** Meu trabalho técnico é informado por um background de pesquisa profundo, desde uma tese sobre ciência cognitiva fundamental na GSU até pesquisa aplicada em **Bio-IA** sobre anti-envelhecimento epigenético. Essa paixão por aplicar IA a desafios científicos continua com meu papel atual como **Estagiário de P&D na Embrapa**, focando em dados & genômica animal.

Estou sempre aberto a me conectar com colegas construtores, pesquisadores e líderes para discutir o futuro dos sistemas inteligentes.

## 🌍 À Propos de Moi

Je suis un jeune professionnel, passionné par la conception et le déploiement de systèmes d'IA fullstack inspirés par mon parcours interdisciplinaire unique : Biologie, Psychologie, Philosophie, Informatique, et Architecture & Ingénierie IA/ML.

Ce n'est pas seulement un travail ou une carrière pour moi ; c'est l'application pratique d'une obsession de toute une vie pour la nature de l'intelligence elle-même, et des années d'études académiques formelles.

Mon idéal à long terme est d'utiliser mon background académique pour faire le pont entre la Biologie et l'IA dans la résolution de problèmes biologiques/biomédicaux du monde réel.

🛠️ **Expertise Technique**

* **Architecture de Systèmes IA & MLOps:** Je conçois des systèmes évolutifs, robustes et intelligents du concept au déploiement. Mon expertise couvre l'ensemble du **cycle de vie ML end-to-end**, de la data science et l'ingénierie des caractéristiques jusqu'aux **MLOps et LLMOps** de niveau production pour garantir que les modèles délivrent une valeur réelle.

* **Full-Stack & Edge AI:** Je maîtrise l'ensemble de la stack technologique. Cela inclut le développement backend (**Python, C++, FastAPI**), l'infrastructure cloud (**AWS**), les bases de données complexes (**PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB**), et les frameworks ML de base (**PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn**), s'étendant jusqu'au développement matériel et **IoT** avec des dispositifs comme l'**ESP32**.

* **IA Agentique & LLMs:** Ma spécialisation se situe à la frontière de l'IA. Je développe des "forces de travail intelligentes" et ai une expérience pratique approfondie dans le post-entraînement des Large Language Models utilisant des techniques avancées comme **SFT et RLHF**.

🏆 **Impact Prouvé & Recherche**

* **Leadership & Projets Primés:** Je prospère dans la collaboration et ai servi comme Chef de Projet au sein de la communauté internationale SuperDataScience. J'ai également été l'architecte et ingénieur solo du **projet gagnant du Global Solution Challenge 2025 de FIAP**.

* **Recherche & Application Interdisciplinaire:** Mon travail technique est informé par un background de recherche approfondi, d'une thèse sur les sciences cognitives fondamentales à GSU à la recherche appliquée en **Bio-IA** sur l'anti-vieillissement épigénétique. Cette passion pour appliquer l'IA aux défis scientifiques continue avec mon rôle actuel de **Stagiaire R&D chez Embrapa**, se concentrant sur les données & la génomique animale.

Je suis toujours ouvert à me connecter avec des collègues constructeurs, chercheurs et dirigeants pour discuter de l'avenir des systèmes intelligents.

* **Full-Stack & Edge AI:** Soy competente en toda la pila tecnológica. Esto incluye desarrollo backend (**Python, C++, FastAPI**), infraestructura en la nube (**AWS**), bases de datos complejas (**PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB**), y frameworks ML principales (**PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn**), extendiéndose hasta desarrollo de hardware e **IoT** con dispositivos como el **ESP32**.

* **IA Agéntica & LLMs:** Mi especialización está en la frontera de la IA. Desarrollo "fuerzas de trabajo inteligentes" y tengo experiencia práctica profunda en post-entrenamiento de Large Language Models usando técnicas avanzadas como **SFT y RLHF**.

🏆 **Impacto Comprobado & Investigación**

* **Liderazgo & Proyectos Premiados:** Prospero en colaboración y he servido como Líder de Proyecto dentro de la comunidad internacional SuperDataScience. También fui el arquitecto e ingeniero único del **proyecto ganador del Global Solution Challenge 2025 de FIAP**.

* **Investigación & Aplicación Interdisciplinaria:** Mi trabajo técnico está informado por un trasfondo de investigación profundo, desde una tesis sobre ciencia cognitiva fundamental en GSU hasta investigación aplicada en **Bio-IA** sobre anti-envejecimiento epigenético. Esta pasión por aplicar IA a desafíos científicos continúa con mi rol actual como **Pasante de I+D en Embrapa**, enfocándome en datos y genómica animal.

Siempre estoy abierto a conectarme con colegas constructores, investigadores y líderes para discutir el futuro de los sistemas inteligentes.
